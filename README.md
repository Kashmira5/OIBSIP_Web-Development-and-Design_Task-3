# Task 3: Basic To-Do Web App

## Objective  
Develop a to-do web application that allows users to add, edit, delete, mark tasks complete, view pending and completed tasks — and persist tasks across sessions using local storage.

## Steps Performed  
- Created input form and lists for “all”, “pending” and “completed” tasks.  
- Built logic to add tasks, mark tasks complete, edit and delete tasks.  
- Integrated `localStorage` so that tasks persist even after the browser is refreshed.  
- Added custom web fonts in CSS for typography, and animations (confetti animation, button hover) to enhance UI.  

## Tools Used  
- HTML5  
- CSS3 (styling, custom fonts, animations)  
- JavaScript

## Outcome  
A to-do web app that not only performs core task-management functions but also retains state between sessions and provides a pleasant user interface.
